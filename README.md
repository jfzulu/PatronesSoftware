# Software Design Patterns Repository

This repository contains examples of commonly used **Software Design Patterns** implemented in various programming languages. These patterns provide standardized solutions to common design challenges, improving the structure and efficiency of software systems.

## Patterns Included

- **Adapter**: Allows incompatible interfaces to work together by wrapping an existing class with a new interface.
- **Bridge**: Decouples an abstraction from its implementation, allowing both to vary independently.
- **Command**: Encapsulates a request as an object, allowing parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations.
- **Composite**: Composes objects into tree-like structures to represent hierarchies, allowing clients to treat individual objects and compositions uniformly.
- **Facade**: Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem, making it easier to use.
- **Iterator**: Provides a way to access elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying structure.
- **Mediator**: Defines an object that encapsulates how objects interact, promoting loose coupling.
- **Observer**: Allows objects to be notified of changes in other objects without tightly coupling them.
- **Proxy**: Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access.
- **Template Method**: Defines the structure of an algorithm in a superclass, allowing subclasses to redefine specific steps.

## Getting Started

Clone this repository to explore and experiment with the patterns:
